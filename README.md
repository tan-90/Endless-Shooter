# EndlessShooter

## About
This project is the result of the amazing course by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) on how to make a game in Unity. It's a top down shooter with some map making utilities, UI, sounds, particles, everything you could want on your learning gamedev project.

## Notes
I didn't use git at all while working on this, so it's just all pushed at once because it's a cool project I want everyone to see.

## Running
This repository uses the given Unity .gitignore so you can just clone it, open the folder in Unity and run the game.
